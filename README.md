# CryptoCurrencyDisplay
With a small LCD coupled with an ESP32 and a lithium battery, i made a pocket size portable display to take on the go. It showcases multiple cryptos in USDC. This is for my brother's birthday, who's a future Wall Street investor. I hope he will remember this and be grateful to me whenever he becomes a multi-millionnaire.
